- PhD in Computer Science from Queen’s University with a focus on high-performance computing, GPU communication, and parallel systems.
- Currently a Member of Technical Staff at AMD, working on the GPU Communication Team and contributing to ROCSHMEM.
- My work centers on GPU-aware communication and middleware optimization for scalable HPC and AI workloads, with prior research experience in OpenMPI and UCX/UCC. I have hands-on experience with CUDA, MPI, OpenMP, Pthreads, Networks, WebGPU, and distributed GPU programming.
- I enjoy working at the intersection of systems research and engineering, as well as teaching and mentoring.
